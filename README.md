# java_learn_recursion_2
Learning Java part 6 - recursion

This was coded as part of a TUM introduction in programming course.
The program is a UTF8-coded java file. The MiniJava file was provided by the chair of Algorithms and Complexity of TU Munich.

Instructions:
In this exercise you should write a program that can calculate the zeros of a third-degree polynomial. We limit ourselves to polynomials whose zeros are integers. 
The user should enter the parameters a3, a2, a1 und a0 eingeben. Your program first calculates a zero using an approximation method, reduces the polynomial by one degree and calculates the remaining zeros for the reduced polynomial using a solution formula (also known as the midnight or pq formula).
